## Objective

Every believer needs a firm foundation of the truth as the strong basis of his/her faith and the knowledge about God and His saving work through Jesus Christ. We are living in a fallen world which is under the spell of devil’s deception. So, we need the knowledge of the absolute truth to tear down every mental and spiritual argument that exalts itself against the knowledge of God.

We need to understand the Bible to receive the knowledge of God which is His precepts for us to be firm and strong in the Lord and to be able to share the truth to others to bring them under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

## Understanding the word _“Bible”_

The word “Bible” is not an English word, but a Greek word transliterated into English. It was taken from the Greek word _“Biblos,”_ or _“Biblion”_. The Greek word _Biblos_ means **books**, or many books, therefore the word “bible” is a general term for any book that you know. But what we are going to study is a different kind of book which is totally distinct from any books - the holy book or the holy Bible. This is known as the sacred Scriptures, from the Latin word _“sacra”_ which means _“holy”._ This book is a Library for it contains many books, that is why it is called Bible.

The Bible that we use to teach the believers is different from all the bible or books on earth because it was authored by God, that is why it is called the holy Bible. When Paul wrote to Timothy, he called the Old Testament writings as the holy Scriptures (2 Timothy 3:15).

## Unique Importance of the Holy Bible

### A. It was the only book authored by God

> 20 knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, 21 for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.
>
> 2Peter 1:20-21 NKJV

> All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness
>
> 2Timothy 3:16 NKJV

> Then the Lord answered me and said: "Write the vision and make it plain on tablets, that he may run who reads it.
>
> Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV

> I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet, 11. saying, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last," and, "What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
>
> Revelation 1:10-11 NKJV

Because the Holy Scriptures has only one Author, though it was written by different writers with different personalities from different ages, they present a marvelous unity that reveals a logical order, accuracy and relevance for thousands of years. That is why our Bible is a sacred book that contains the word of God, written by God’s servants under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.

### B. It is the revelation of God to man

#### 1. It contains the truth how God created the heavens and the earth and everything that is in it including man.

> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
>
> Genesis 1:1 NKJV

> You alone are the Lord; You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and everything on it, the seas and all that is in them, And You preserve them all. The host of heaven worships You.
>
> Nehemiah 9:6 NKJV

All the answers about the existence of this physical world and all that are in it were already written in the holy Bible.

#### 2. It contains God’s revelation to man for us to know Him and understand how to relate with Him

> Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,
> but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.
>
> Hebrews 1:1-2 ESV

#### 3. It contains the divine laws for governing Israel and to keep us before the coming of faith in Christ

> Give me understanding, that I may keep Your law and observe it with my whole heart
> Lead me in the path of your commandments, for I delight in it.
>
> Psalms 119:34-35 ESV

> But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed.
>
> Galatians 3:23 NKJV

#### 4. It contains the truth about the salvation of man

> and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
>
> 2Timothy 3:15 NKJV

> You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me.
>
> John 5:39 NKJV

> Then He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, 47. and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.”
>
> Luke 24:46-47 NKJV

The holy Bible contains the revelation of God to man because God is its main Author. Its ultimate purpose is the salvation of those who will believe in Christ Jesus as the only way to the Father. After being justified by faith and made holy, the Bible has all the revelation of Jesus Christ for us to grow in knowing Him more, and the instructions that we need to live our new life in Christ, as Paul was instructing the churches and the certain individuals through his letters.

### C. The Holy Bible is the only reference in knowing the truth

> The entirety of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous judgments endures forever.
>
> Psalms 119:160 NKJV

As God is true, so is His word.

> This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. Because God is light, His word is also light.
>
> 1 John 1:5 NKJV

> Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.
>
> Psalms 119:105 NKJV

The word of God as the truth is _infallible_, which means not capable of making mistakes, therefore, it will not be erroneous. Since it is not capable of making mistakes, it can sanctify us from all forms of human errors. The Bible also reveals the truth about God, about man, and the truth about eternal life that God has designed for man including His ultimate purpose by which man should walk.

There is no lie in the truth:

> I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
>
> 1 John 2:21 NKJV

### D. Jesus is the main character

Jesus Himself told this truth.

> Then He said to them, "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me."
>
> 1 John 2:21 NKJV

> For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.
>
> John 5:46 NKJV

> but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.
>
> John 20:31 NKJV

Here is the wonder of it all: In the 66 books of the Bible, 39 in the Old testament and 27 in the New Testament, with 1,189 chapters made up of 31,173 verses (based on KJV), we find perfect harmony and unity which binds the whole together. You know why the Bible is perfect in unity? It is because all the law and the prophets are pointing to Jesus. It is the person of Jesus Christ that made the unity and the cohesion of the entire Scriptures. That is why if the church will genuinely accept the Lordship of Jesus Christ, we will achieve the unity that Jesus Christ had prayed for.

### E. The basic structure of the Bible

- Books of history and biography

  - Genesis to Esther

- Books of the law (TORAH)

  - Genesis – Deuteronomy

- Books of poetry and wisdom

  - Job – Song of Solomon

- Books of Prophecy

  - Major prophets – Isaiah to Daniel
  - Minor prophets – Hosea to Malachi

- The Gospel books

  - Matthew to John

- The Book of Acts

  - The history of the church when the Christians received the baptism of Holy Spirit and testified about the death and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. It tells us how salvation through Jesus Christ was accepted by the Jews and Gentiles until they grew in number rapidly.

- The Epistles

  - Romans to Jude

- The Book of Revelation
  - This book contains promises, warnings, call to repentance for the churches, and the revelation of God to John about the divine plans for the end times and the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. As the Law started to talk about Jesus in the Old testament, the ending of the last book of the New Testament is still speaks about the Lord Jesus Christ, because He is the Alpha and Omega, the First and Last, the Beginning the End.

## Conclusion

Let us see Jesus in the pages of the Scriptures and it will make us wise to teach and disciple others.
